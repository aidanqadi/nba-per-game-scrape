# nba-per-game-scrape
This project builds a complete data pipeline for NBA per-game stats from 2020–2024 by scraping RealGM’s public tables, cleaning and standardizing them into a single Pandas DataFrame, and answering five analytical questions in a styled Jupyter Notebook (nba_analysis_styled.ipynb) with annotated Seaborn plots. Included are earlier iterations
